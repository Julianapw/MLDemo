# MLDemo

## Description
This repository contains the code developed by me during the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations** course, offered by Oracle.  
The purpose of the course was to introduce the **fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, covering topics such as learning paradigms, data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.

The project included in this repository is a **practical Machine Learning demonstration** using the classic **Iris Dataset**, with a focus on data analysis and building and experimenting with models in Python through Jupyter Notebooks.
